# Classification Machine Learning Model
This project demonstrates the development of a basic machine learning classification model designed to predict whether a patient having heart disease. Leveraging the widely used scikit-learn library, various classification algorithms are implemented, trained, and evaluated to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Key highlights of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Ensuring the dataset is clean, balanced, and ready for model training.
Model Training: Applying popular classification techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and others.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to achieve the best performance.
Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model effectiveness.
This project serves as a practical example for beginners and enthusiasts looking to understand the end-to-end process of developing and fine-tuning machine learning classification models, especially in the domain of healthcare analytics.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own classification tasks!
