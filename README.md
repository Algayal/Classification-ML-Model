## Description of Structure

### Point of the Project
To showcase the end-to-end process of developing and fine-tuning machine learning classification models with healthcare analytics as the primary focus.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, balancing, and preparing the dataset for training.  
- **Model Training:** Implementation of popular classification techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing parameters for enhanced model performance.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Utilizing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model validation.

### Libraries Used
`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Deployment
This project is designed for local exploration and can be adapted for cloud deployment if required.

### How the Code Works
1. Preprocessed data is fed into the classification models.  
2. Models are trained, and their performance is evaluated on validation datasets.  
3. Outputs include detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations for better understanding.
